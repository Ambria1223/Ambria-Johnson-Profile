<p> Hello, my name is Ambria Johnson and I have recently switched my career path from 
    retail pharmacy to software engineering. 
      <br> With my previous experience being in retail pharmacy, I have used many software applications 
      that make the day to day customer and worker experience smoother.<br> 
      There are some aspects of the software that I have seen 
      lack efficiency and I would like to use my background to make these experiences more proactive for the user. </p>
