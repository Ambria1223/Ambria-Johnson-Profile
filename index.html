        <h1>Ambria Johnson Profile</h1>

<p> Hello, my name is Ambria Johnson and I have currently switched my career path from retail pharmacy to software engineering. With my previous experiennce with being in retail pharmacy, I have used many software applications that make the day to day customer and worker experience smooher. 
    There are some aspects of the software that I have seen lack efficiency and I would like to use my background to make these experiences more proactive for the user. </p>
