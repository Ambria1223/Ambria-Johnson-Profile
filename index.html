 <p> Hello, my name is Ambria Johnson and I have currently switched my career path from 
  retail pharmacy to software engineering. 
    <br> With my previous experience being in retail pharmacy, I have used many software applications 
    that make the day to day customer and worker experience smoother.<br> 
    There are some aspects of the software that I have seen 
    lack efficiency and I would like to use my background to make these experiences more proactive for the user. </p>
